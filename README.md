I'm a professional web developer with expertise in JavaScript and full-stack development. I've worked on teams for many large enterprise clients such as Under Armour, Nike, Microsoft. In addition, I have worked with startups and smaller shops to create solutions based on their needs, greenfield projects, highly speced code, and working with business and clients to provide successful solutions.

Until recently, I worked with Twin Technologies, a technology consulting firm focused on delivering high quality solutions to Fortune 500 clients. In this role I was focused on working with teams at Under Armour to provide solutions to business requirements, ranging from custom front-end implementations, CMS modifications, to micro service creation. Successes included creating custom reusable cms tools and widgets that allow dynamic creation of full pages and building out an extensive well tested api to be consumed by any platform.

Colleagues know me as a highly talented developer who can always be trusted to reliably provide work displaying craftsmanship and quality. My work shows I am passionate about the field and enjoy what I do. 

I particularly love working with frontend technologies creating apps or custom design implementations. I am always staying up to date on the latest trends and ways to improve myself.

I have a B.S. degree in Management Information Systems from Indiana University.

I'm currently freelancing while I explore new opportunities and can be reached either through this profile or by phone at 574-276-5819.
