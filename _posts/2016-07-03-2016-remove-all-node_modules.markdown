NPM is a great package manager, but with many projects setup in a dev folder, the size of all these packages can get quite large.

To trim down the size of my dev folder I’ll run this command to recursively remove any node_modules folder and its contents.

**Remove node_modules recursively**
{% highlight bash %}
find . -name "node_modules" -exec rm -rf '{}' +
{% endhighlight %}

For projects I’m actively working in or revisiting I can just run `npm install` again in their directory.
